# Finance Ledger Yearly (FLY)

## Overview

Finance Ledger Yearly (FLY) is a comprehensive financial data app designed to automate the extraction and processing of financial data from various online sources. The app retrieves detailed company information, financial documents, and standardized financial statements, storing this data in a local SQLite database for easy access and analysis.

## Features

- **Company Information Scraping**: Extracts details such as ticker symbols, trading information, governance levels, CNPJ, sector classification, website, and more from the B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão) website.
- **NSD (Document Number) Scraping**: Generates and scrapes NSD values to fetch detailed financial documents and metadata, including auditor information and document dates.
- **Financial Sheets Scraping**: Retrieves standardized financial statements and quarterly information, processes the data, and stores it in a structured format.
